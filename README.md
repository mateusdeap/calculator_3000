# Calculator3000

A very not ambitious project. Just wanted to test if I could learn how test in Elixir and make something of my own.

Maybe I'll add more functionality. If I do, I'll start by adding implementations of common math functions and see where I'll go from there

## Dependencies

This project requires Elixir 1.13 or later

## Installation

Simply clone the repo or download it, run `mix deps.get` and Bob's your uncle
